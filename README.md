##Time-Of-Use Alert##

Currently there are three rate classes:
*	Off-Peak		base rate 1x
*	Partial-Peak	base rate 1.7x
*	Peak			base rate 3.4x
The times for the rate classes varies for winter and summer seasons
hours of the day and holidays. While the time pattern is fixed in the
program, the hours and dates can be set. The holiday dates are
calculated automatically.

The purpose of the gadget is to raise awareness of the TOU rates to
help maximize electric bill savings.
